# NQueens
The N-Queens Problem is the problem of finding all possible ways of placing N
queens on an N-by-N chess board so that no queen attacks any other queen.

This code provides a solution for finding all the combinations and unique combinations for N queens problem

This solution meets the following requirements:
01. Non-recursion way
02.  work for any value of N.
03. Your source code will have reasonable number of meaningful comment
lines.
04. Your source code will be neatly structured.
05. Your test run will produce output for N = 4, N = 5, and N = 8.
06. Your output will include total number of peaceful placements and the
number of distinct (fundamental) placements for each case.
07. Your output will contain only distinct (fundamental) peaceful placements â€“
each one in the form of a chess board (table) with queens in correct positions
(the letter Q or the chess figure for queen).
